NG (NotGoogle) is a neat search engine that utilizes the [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) algorithm  
The application consists of a crawling component and a search component where the crawling component  
runs many _workers_ concurrently which traverse the web, collect selective data of the websites visited and ranks them  
The data generated by the workers builds up an _index_ which is stored in an SQLite database  
The search engine component queries the index for a particular search string and retrieves relevant  
webite and image results to the user. For a comprehensive guide of the application see [Documentation](Documentation.pdf)
